The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Every year it is given to scientists and scholars in chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out back in 1901, and at that time the prize was Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way. Surely, right?

Well, let's find out about that! We'll go over questions like: 
1.    What characteristics do the prize winners have? 
2.    Which country gets it most often? 
3.    Has anybody gotten it twice?

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nobelfoundation/nobel-laureates) used in this project is from The Nobel Foundation on Kaggle.

In this notebook, I will be using the following packages: 
1.    lubridate
2.    tidyverse
3.    ggplot2
